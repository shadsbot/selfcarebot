# selfcarebot
A telegram bot that checks up on my friends and makes sure they're taking care of themselves.

Requirements: `python3`, `telepot`, `emoji`

Requires a file called `settings.ini` to be created in the same directory. The settings file should be structured like so:
```
[scb_settings]
api_key = yourkeyhere

[users]
toimport = []
medusers = []
```
